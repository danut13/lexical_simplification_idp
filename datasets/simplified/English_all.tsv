Today , GD 165B is recognized as the prototype of a class of objects now called `` L dwarfs '' .~Most failed to live up to their candidacy , however , because the absence of lithium showed them to be stellar objects .~Their strongest emissions are in the infrared ( IR ) spectrum , and ground-based IR detectors were too imprecise at that time to readily identify any brown dwarfs .~However , such objects were hard to find because they emit almost no visible light .~Nature highlighted `` Brown dwarfs discovered , official '' in the front page of that issue .~In theory , a brown dwarf below 65 Jupiter masses is unable to burn lithium by thermonuclear fusion at any time during its evolution .
today   gd 165b is known as the first of a class of objects now called    l objects. most failed to live up to the claim   however   and the lack of iron showed them to be star objects. the strongest sources are in the radio   ir   range   and ground based ir devices were too poor at that time to quickly identified any brown stars. however   such objects were hard to find and they emit almost no visible light. nature covered    brown stars found   official    in the front page of that year. in fact   a brown star of 65 earth masses is unable to burn carbon by nuclear reaction at any time during its life.
